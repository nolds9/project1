DC-WDI7 Project 1

This trivia game takes a set of preloaded questions stored in an object littoral and presents them successively to the player to answer.  If a answer is correct it is logged below next the the number of total questions.  There is a count down timer displayed at the top of the page that counts down from 90 seconds.  The game is completed after the player answers all questions, or the timer runs out.  Once the game ends a message is displayed that is dependent on how well the user performed.  A reset button also appears that lets the game be reset for successive plays.

Near term features that I would still like to implement:

1 - User name input function
2 - Use browser memory to store recent games
3 - Display recent games according to score in a leaderboard
4 - Allow user to select how many cards to play in a certain time limit
5 - Randomize cards to play
6 - Allow user to create trivia cards

Original User Stories for Project 1:

1) The user should be able to to enter their name so that their score can be tracked.
2) The user should be able to click on the answer of their desired choice to submit it as an answer.
3) The user should be able to select how many questions the game will last for so that the user will have enough time to play.
4) The user should be displayed with the total amount of questions that were answered correctly and how many were answered incorrectly.
5) The user should have the option to review questions that were answered incorrectly.
