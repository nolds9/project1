# Project Feedback

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Nice job managing your time and planning process to meet an achievable scope for the first project, as demonstrated by your user stories! Thanks for writing out thoughts in the readme and for updating it with some things you'd like to get to in the future. As we move forward for larger projects, it would be nice to have more thoughts from your planning process, such as a Trello board, and relevant wireframes.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Congratulations.  All the concepts covered during the first few week of WDI are represented.  You have tackled some complex problems. I recommend that if you wanted to come back to this, there are some low-hanging fruit that can be easily knocked out.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. Html is clearly structured, CSS is clear, and JS works. I especially liked how you took an Object Oriented approach with your JS. Make sure to clean up code, remove comments, fix indentation, and you check your code in a validator in the future. Moving forward, try to watch for duplication and areas where you can group functionality into functions.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations** Excellent job on this project! It looks like you had fun with this one, and made it your own. I would really like to see you implement the wish-list features outlined in your readme.
